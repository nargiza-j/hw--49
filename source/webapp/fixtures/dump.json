    "description": "The Australian Version of the popular Writing with Symbols 2000 software has some new features, in particular a set of Australian symbols and a spelling list for Australian users.\r\n\r\nIt remains as one of the most flexible support packages for literacy development, and can be used in four ways. An increasingly, schools are using it as a mainstream product, supporting their students with special learning, literacy and/or access needs. Primary schools have found that it offers a different approach to writing, reading and literacy development.
